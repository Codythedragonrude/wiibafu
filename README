This document contains important notes for Wii Backup Fusion


Look & Feel of Qt applications
==============================

You can configure the look & feel of Qt applications, incl. Wii Backup Fusion.
This contains GUI styles, 3-D effects, fonts, interface settings and so on.
Use Qt's own setting editor 'qtconfig', it's in "<Qt-Dir>/qt/bin/"!


WBFS partitions/hdds
====================

WiiBaFu needs root/admin permissions to access WBFS hdds/partitions!
If WiiBaFu don't work with your user permissions, start WiiBaFu with
'sudo WiiBaFu' or in admin mode!


DVD drive
=========

The dvd drive path is platform specific. For Linux use /dev/sr0 for the
first S-ATA drive (must be adapted to your drive), for Mac OS X use normally
/dev/disk2 (Mac with integrated hdd and dvd drive). On Windows, WIT use cygwin
to access the drive, the drive letters doesn't work! Use /dev/sr0 for the
first S-ATA drive (must be adapted to your drive).
